# mySQM+ 3DPrints

Unofficial 3D prints designed to work with the [mySQM+ DIY SQM WEATHER STATION](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqmproesp32/files) project by Robert Brown.

These prints will be installed outdoors to monitor weather and will be subjected to the elements over time. The recommend material for 3D printing is ASA or PETG, both of which are insensitive to changing temperature and are resistant to UV rays. The UV resistance is key to choosing one of these materials.

ATTRIBUTE: This is a redesign of the mySQM+ 3D prints created by Robert Brown for his mySQM+ DIY SQM WEATHER STATION project found on Sourceforge at the link https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysqmproesp32/files

Incorporating the threaded joint idea from the rework of Robert Brown's anemometer design that was made by [CBaker007](https://github.com/CBaker007/mySQM-3D_Anemometer/)
